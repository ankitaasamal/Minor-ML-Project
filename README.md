# 6th Semester Minor-ML-Project
Breast Cancer Detection tool Using Machine Learning Classifier

In todayâ€™s world we know how big of a disease cancer is which causes highest number of deaths. Cancer is a collection of more than 100 different and individual
diseases. It can evolve in any part of the body and have many different forms in each body part. Breast Cancer is one among them and it is the most widespread type of cancer among women all over the world. The diagnosis of breast cancer manually takes long 
time and there is low availability of systems, we require to develop the automatic diagnosis system for early detection of breast cancer.
So we have developed a diagnosis model in our project for which we studied the different supervised machine learning classifiers and compared them to get to know which classifier is giving the best accuracy. For that we took the dataset from the UCI ML- Wisconsin breast cancer database which is the benchmark database for comparing the results through different algorithms.

We have used the following classification techniques of machine learning for our project implementation: like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, KNN Classifier, Naive Bayes, Decision trees, Extract Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Ada boost Classifier, XG Boost, Stacking Classifier and 
Voting Classifier for the classification of benign and malignant tumor in which the machine is learned from the past data and can predict the category of new 
input.
